            <p>
                Realeased in 2009 Minecraft has been a staple of the gaming comunity for over a decade.
                When starting out the game was updated monthly as the devs (Notch and Jens) along with help from many
                others
                began the creation of the now top sandbox game. This game picked up popularity almos instantly becoming
                a
                succes. Though this succes lead to Mojang Studios being able to continue it also lead to a large amount
                of
                popularity. This popularity eventualy came back to haunt notch wishing he could make an update withi\out
                thousand of questions.
                Evenetually Notch sold the game to the multi Billion dollar Company "Microsoft".
                Though today the game is still being coded and ran by Mojang Studios with Microsoft breathing down their
                neck it will never be the same.
